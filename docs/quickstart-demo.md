# 30-Second Quick Start Demo

This demo is the shortest way to show what CodeWard does in a public README, blog post, or launch thread.

![CodeWard 30-second PR demo](assets/codeward-30s-demo.gif)

The GIF shows a simulated local PR where a checkout form changed. CodeWard does not report a real browser test pass during `--dry-run`. It reports the generated verification artifact: the affected flow, the planned Playwright draft path, static self-check status, and the remaining work before the draft can be trusted as PR evidence.

## Story

A reviewer sees a PR that changes a checkout form:

```txt
src/app/checkout/page.tsx
src/features/checkout/CheckoutForm.tsx
src/features/checkout/submitCheckout.ts
```

The reviewer wants to know:

- Which user flow is affected?
- Should this become a Playwright test, a manual checklist, or only a review note?
- What blocks the generated draft from being trusted as regression coverage?

## Command

Run CodeWard on the branch:

```sh
pnpm dlx @ivorycanvas/codeward e2e draft . --base origin/main --head HEAD --dry-run
```

`--dry-run` is important for first contact. It lets maintainers preview the plan, draft path, readiness, and blockers without writing files.

For a repository adopting CodeWard as team QA memory, start with the manifest loop:

```sh
pnpm dlx @ivorycanvas/codeward manifest context .
pnpm dlx @ivorycanvas/codeward manifest init .
pnpm dlx @ivorycanvas/codeward manifest validate .
pnpm dlx @ivorycanvas/codeward manifest explain . --base origin/main --head HEAD
```

The manifest is the durable part. It lets a team correct domains, flows, anchors, and checks once, then reuse that correction across future PRs without re-explaining the same QA context to an LLM.

## What CodeWard Reads

```txt
Input
- git diff between origin/main and HEAD
- package.json scripts and dependencies
- framework and route files
- existing E2E runner config
- stable selectors such as data-testid, aria-label, role text, placeholder text, and testID
- optional team-owned context in .codeward/manifest.yaml, CONTEXT.md, ADRs, goals, QA runbooks, and agent instructions
```

## What CodeWard Returns

```txt
Output
- changed domain language
- candidate user flow
- manifest evidence when a repo-local flow/check matches
- recommended runner
- draft file path
- flow language brief
- runnable status
- self-check status
- required action items
- blockers that explain why a draft is not ready yet
```

The result should not stop at "selector needed" or "fixture needed." A useful CodeWard draft should say which flow changed, which test file would be generated, which checks it covers, why those checks were selected, and where to update the manifest if the recommendation is wrong.

## Markdown Preview

```txt
CodeWard E2E Draft
Mode: dry run (no files were written)
Project: Web
Recommended runner: Playwright
Files: 0 created, 1 previewed, 0 skipped

- preview: tests/e2e/checkout-purchase.spec.ts
  Flow: Checkout purchase
  Actor: Customer
  Trigger: Open route /checkout.
  Goal: Complete checkout with realistic form data.
  Success signal: confirmation state is visible after submit
  Reviewer question: Can a customer still complete checkout after this PR?
  Runnable status: near-runnable
  Promotion status: needs-review

Required action items:
- Add or confirm stable selectors for changed checkout controls.
- Add deterministic payment/customer fixture data.
- Review generated assertions against the real success and error states.
- Run pnpm run test:e2e after reviewing the generated draft.

Top blockers:
- Playwright config was not detected.
- Fixture or mock data was not found for the checkout submit path.
```

## Draft Shape

```ts
import { expect, test } from "@playwright/test";

test("Checkout purchase", async ({ page }) => {
  await test.step("Open route /checkout.", async () => {
    await page.goto("/checkout");
  });

  await test.step("Fill checkout email.", async () => {
    await page.getByPlaceholder("Email").fill("buyer@example.com");
  });

  await test.step("Fill checkout name.", async () => {
    await page.getByPlaceholder("Name").fill("Ada Lovelace");
  });

  await test.step("Submit checkout.", async () => {
    await page.getByRole("button", { name: "Complete purchase" }).click();
  });

  await expect(page.getByText("Order confirmed")).toBeVisible();
});
```

In the demo branch, the generated test is meant to protect this review question:

```txt
Can a customer still complete the Checkout purchase flow after the checkout form change?
```

The draft covers:

- entering the checkout route
- using the changed checkout form controls
- checking the success/confirmation state
- checking the invalid-input recovery path

The dry-run result is intentionally conservative:

```txt
Generated E2E draft: yes
Static Playwright self-check: pass
Browser test execution: not run in --dry-run
Still required: deterministic fixture/mock data and real pnpm run test:e2e execution
```

## Recording A Short GIF

Use a tiny branch where a form, button, route, or API client changed. The recording only needs three terminal moments:

```sh
git diff --stat origin/main...HEAD
pnpm dlx @ivorycanvas/codeward e2e draft . --base origin/main --head HEAD --dry-run
pnpm dlx @ivorycanvas/codeward verify . --base origin/main --head HEAD --format markdown
```

The best GIF is not a long terminal scroll. Show:

- the changed files
- the generated flow name
- the planned draft path
- the required action items
- the no-write `--dry-run` line

## Launch Message

```txt
CodeWard turns a PR diff into domain-aware verification flows and draft E2E tests.

It runs locally, does not upload source code, and does not call an LLM API.

Try it:
pnpm dlx @ivorycanvas/codeward e2e draft . --base origin/main --head HEAD --dry-run
```
